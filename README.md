# Google Map Postcard
We broke up lol, but I'm still proud of the technical aspects of this site despite it being simple html CSS so it'll stay up I guess.
This project wa a gift. It uses Google Map API
to create markers at special/date locations which open up new HTML pages with cool content !

## Built with:
This project is relativly simply it's pretty minimal javascript with the Google Maps API everything else is HTML and CSS.
