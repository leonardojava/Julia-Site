# Google Map Postcard(For Julia)
This project is a gift for my girlfriend Julia, it uses Google Map API
to create markers at special/date locations which open up new HTML pages with cool content !
**note while I was making this google maps marker got deprecated and I was too lazy to change it

## Built with:
This project is relativly simply it's pretty minimal javascript with the Google Maps API everything else is HTML and CSS.

## Contribuiting:
uh right now I don't want any contributions made to this repository for obvious reasons but in the future I do plan on making a public web app that allows people to use this template to create their own maps and markers so that'd be cool :3
