    <h1>Greetings From Pikes Place Market!</h1>
    <p>   This is the first one I started with so sorry if it's too yappy. Pikes place is definitly my favorite date, nothing wrong with the other ones but that day with you was really special.
        It probably was also the longest date on record since we basically spent the whole day there, even though we had so much fun it felt like it passed in minutes.
        Everytime I think about you I think about this special day, which happens to be everyday. I love you.</p>
