    <h1>Greetings From Storia Cucina at Bellingham!</h1>
    <p>
      This was one of the most relax dates most of it was enjoying the scenery with you. The hardest part was keeping my eyes off you. Even though it was pretty chill
      we had a lot of funny moments like ordering at the restruant lol. Maybe when we're really old and can't run around Vancouver as much we can have fun relaxed dates 
      like this again and again. I look forward to it.
