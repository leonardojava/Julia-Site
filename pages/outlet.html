    <h1>Greetings From Seattle Premium Outlets!</h1>
    <p>
        To be honest this was one of the more boring dates but it definitly had iconic moments. Like the iconic shit McDonalds or the iconic oversized Jordan 4s or the iconic
      30 minute shwarma chase. THIS DATE HAD IT ALL RAHH. Although it did get boring walking around the same outlet for 4 hours since I couldn't drive us anywhere else yet it 
      def got carried by FIRST KISS! :).

    <p><b>DATE RATING: 7/10</b></p>
