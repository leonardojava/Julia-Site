    <h1>Greetings From Lansdowne Centre!</h1>
    <p>
      This was another one of the chiller dates but it was still SUPA FUN. I still remember watching community in bed while eating peanut sauce rice roll. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ME ON BABE!
      Personally all our dates where we're chilling at one of our houses are TOP TIER. Can't wait to just chill at our own house someday. Love you honey!
