    <h1>Greetings From Regal Cinemas at Bellingham!</h1>
    <p>
        In my opinion this a solid top 10 date. Even though the steak was pretty mid eating it with you elevated it by ONE MILLIPN PERCENT.
      Chris Pratt's phenomenal performance of Mario definitly laid the foundation of how the date would go to. However that pop corn and drink was too fucking expensive.
      Like fr our meal at the resturant next store cost less then the movie and snacks itself fuck the cinema industry on god.

    <p><b>DATE RATING: 9/10</b></p>
