    <h1>Greetings From Richmond Centre!</h1>
    <p>   THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL. It's kind of crazy to think we only met a little over a year and couple months ago but here we are. At least we aren't as awkward as we were back then huh.
        To be honest it was mostly you being akward. #bangs But now we basically meet up at Richmond Centre every time I come over and everytime I remember that first time. kiss </p>
